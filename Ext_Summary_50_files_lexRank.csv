Firstly,  the past year has been very challenging,  both operationally and financially. Business performance has fallen short  of expectations, we have outgrown some  of our business processes and controls,  and we have experienced significant  changes to our Board. Equally, and more importantly, it is  already clear that the years ahead  present significant upside opportunities. Strong value creation will result if we  effectively implement our new strategy  and successfully manage NCC Group  through the transitional period in which  we now find ourselves.."

We summarise our latest  improvements across. Integrated reporting has become modern best practice  for annual reporting, adopted by a growing community  of organisations that have recognised that strategy, risk,  performance and sustainability are inseparable and are   integral to an organisation’s success. The International Integrated Reporting Council (IRRC) define  an integrated report as “a concise communication about how  an organisation’s strategy, governance, performance and  prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to  the creation of value in the short, medium and long-term” . Find out more about integrated reporting at:   Changes to this year’s Annual Report and  Financial Statements We continue to evolve our Annual Report to meet latest  business, stakeholder and legislative requirements, to follow  best practice, and to embed the principles of the integrated  approach. This year we have: •  Included more information to explain how we assure the  contents of this publication. We make clear what assurance  route has been used for each report included within this  Annual Report and Financial Statements (ARFS). •  The Strategic Report has been updated to further develop  the summary of our strategy and business model, including  further explanation of our resources and relationships, and  how we perform relative to others. We have also reviewed  our reporting of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to clarify  those which are regulatory and to report the headlines  of our ambition to go further, with links to further  information on our website. •  Expanded our explanation of risk, introducing a ‘heat map’  and showing risk movement in the year.."

The price of oil was  consolidating and signs of recovery  across the industry were in sight. Twelve months later and the sector  has rebounded strongly. Thanks to  our efforts in 2016, Nostra Terra was  well positioned to benefit greatly  from this. The Company has since  taken significant steps forward in  realising its ambitions, delivering  robust returns for shareholders. Our strategic focus switched in 2016  to repositioning our portfolio of assets  with the goal of growing stable oil  production and reserves, which would  be profitable at $30/bbl. In particular  we sought to acquire leases, which were  Held By Production (HBP). This ideally  suited Nostra Terra because it meant we  could control the pace of development  of these assets, as conditions and our  finances allowed. In early 2017 we completed our  second acquisition in the Permian Basin,  Texas, and by April had increased the  Company’s current proven reserves (1P)  in the US to 522,000 barrels.."

Our point-of-care (POC) products, most of which are designed and manufactured in Germany,  have a hard earned reputation for ease of use, reliability and accuracy from professionals working  in diabetes, blood banking and sports medicine. The POC business is built around a large installed base of analysers each of which generates a  regular demand for tests, often for the entire life cycle of the analyser. In 2017 we sold an estimated  70 million tests. This approach – sometimes known as the ‘razor/razorblade’ model – permits a  percentage of organic growth each year. The EKF Central Laboratory range includes clinical reagents and centrifuges which are manufactured  at premises near San Antonio, Texas. Clinical chemistry reagents are sold for use on open channel  systems or on EKF’s own brand of analysers.

COMPLETION OF GROWTH ACCELERATION PLAN In 2017 , Informa delivered a fourth consecutive year of growth   in revenue, adjusted earnings, cash flow and dividends. The year  also saw the Group fulfil its ambition to return all four Operating  Divisions to positive underlying revenue growth. These results are built on the foundations of the previous four  years, and the measures taken under GAP to increase the  Group’s focus on customers and vertical industries, build market  positions and strengthen overall operational capabilities. This started with talent and experience, including appointing   new Divisional CEOs and a dedicated CTO in each Division. It continued through proactive portfolio management, exiting  businesses and markets that were not core or where we were  sub-scale, and expanding in geographies and verticals where the  growth opportunities were most attractive, particularly in the US.."

Corero Network Security plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 What is a DDoS attack? A Distributed Denial of Service  attack is a cyber-threat, in which  multiple computer systems  attack a target, such as a server,  website or other network asset,  and cause a denial of service for  users of the targeted resource. The flood of incoming messages,  connection requests or  malformed packets to the target  system, forces it to slow down or  shut down, thereby denying  service to legitimate users or  systems. DDoS attacks are a  threat to service availability,  network security, brand  reputation and ultimately lead to  lost revenues. Attackers are continuing to  leverage DDoS attacks as part of  their cyber-threat arsenal to  either disrupt business  operations or provide a  smokescreen while they access  sensitive corporate information,  and they are doing it in  increasingly creative ways that  circumvent traditional security  solutions or reduce the previous  effectiveness of DDoS scrubbing  centres. 49% of companies discovered  a virus following a DDoS  attack      27 % increase in breach incidents  experienced in concert   with DDoS attacks $250,000 (per hour) revenue at risk in the   face of a DDoS attack*      90% of organisations report  some form of breach or   associated activity with  DDoS attacks Corero Network Security is a leader in real-time, high-performance  Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) defence solutions. Service  providers, cloud providers and digital enterprises rely on Corero’s award  winning SmartWall® Network Threat Defense System (“SmartWall”)  technology to eliminate the DDoS threat to their environment through  automatic attack detection and mitigation, coupled with network  visibility, analytics and reporting. The impact of DDoS attacks Why is there a need for businesses to address DDoS threats? • Availability and security of Internet services and applications is essential   for digital / online businesses  • Downtime or compromise equates to: • Lost revenues and additional operational costs • Unhappy customers with increased costs for retention of existing   customers and acquisition of new customers • Brand and reputation damage  • Legal liability and fines  (Source: Neustar Global DDoS Attacks & Cyber Security Insights Report October 2017) * As estimated by 49% of over 1,000 respondents in a Neustar survey For more information    Contents Overview 01 Highlights 02 Corero at a glance 03 What we do 05 Our proposition Strategic Report 06 Chief Executive’s strategic update 10 Market overview 12 Our business model 14 Our strategy 17 Principal risks and uncertainties 18 Financial review Governance 20 Board of Directors 22 Chairman’s Introduction 23 Corporate Governance Report 26 Directors’ Report 29 Statement of Director’s Responsibilities Financial statements 30 Independent Auditor’s Report 34 Consolidated Statement of   Comprehensive Income 35 Consolidated Statement of Financial Position 36 Company Statement of Financial Position 37 Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows 38 Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity 39 Company Statement of Changes in Equity 40 Notes to the Financial Statements Corporate Directory 64 Corporate Directory Highlights Customer wins across the SmartWall target markets – service providers,  cloud providers and digital enterprises.."

These are non-IFRS measures which exclude the impact of the amortisation of acquisition intangible assets  (FY17: £14.1m, FY16: £10.4m). Acquisition intangible assets principally arise as a result of the past actions of the former owners of  businesses in respect of marketing and business development activity. Therefore, the adjusted measures reflect the post acquisition  revenue attributable to, and operating costs incurred by, the Group. A reconciliation between the adjusted and statutory equivalent is  included in the Financial review.

and  Emerainville, as well as Chiswick and Combs-la-Ville and the closure of Deptford in the current financial year. In addition, the impact of the acquisition of Space Maker on 29 July 2016 has  been adjusted. 4  Underlying EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent  and depreciation. Underlying profit before tax is defined as underlying EBITDA less leasehold rent, depreciation charged on property, plant and equipment and net finance charges relating to  bank loans and cash. 5   Profit before tax decreased by £16.0 million to £78.9 million (FY2016: £94.9 million) principally as a result of exceptional costs totalling £17.7 million (FY2016: exceptional income of  £4.3 million), which includes exceptional refinancing costs of £16.3 million, and a reduction in the gain on investment properties by £2.5 million to £39.2 million (FY2016: £41.7 million),  offset by an improvement in underlying EBITDA of £8.7 million.."

At the same time the Group achieved impressive growth in line with market expectations, delivering an increase in Group  revenue of 65.1%, including 19.8% organic growth. The Group’s transformation consisted of the acquisition of Systems Professional Limited (“Sys-Pro”) in early July,  complementing the Group’s existing managed services business, and an associated re-branding of the business from  Daily Internet Plc to SysGroup Plc. This, combined with the subsequent disposal of the Company’s legacy, non-core  SME Mass Market hosting division, resulted in the formation of a business focused exclusively on servicing the high value  managed services market, with a strong focus on cloud. To facilitate the funding of the Sys-Pro, the Group completed an oversubscribed placing in July raising £5.0m gross and  bringing a number of new institutional shareholders onto the Company’s register. In conjunction with the placing and  acquisition, the Company also undertook a 40 for 1 share consolidation and sought court approval for the cancellation of  its share premium account, leaving the parent company able to pay dividends in the future should it be appropriate to do  so (see note 22). In order to support the new business composition and operational focus, a number of organisational changes were  implemented to restructure the Group, including the appointment of Julian Llewellyn as CFO and Amy Yateman-Smith as  Non-Executive Director.."

This enables us to create and  identify novel synthetic and defined  small molecule chemicals that can  be applied as crop enhancement  (sometimes known as biostimulant) foliar sprays and seed treatments.

WHAT WE DO Our 20MW ‘FlexGen’ sites – which can  generate power within 30 seconds of  being switched on remotely – provide  a vital, low cost solution to assist in  balancing the UK’s energy supply on a  moment by moment basis. Since the introduction of intermittent,  renewable power to the UK’s energy  mix as legacy carbon intensive capacity  is retired, the National Grid has faced  increasing risks of brownouts and  blackouts. UK power prices have seen  recent peaks above £1,500 per MW  hour due to outage and generation  imbalances; there is therefore a need  for a reliable source of power that can  be accessed quickly and flexibly during  periods when demand exceeds available  supply. HOW WE OPERATE Our facilities use established, reliable  technology based on containerised  generators, fired with renewable green  fuel or gas – either mains or Liquidified  Natural Gas (LNG). Nine green fuel projects have been  financed with a combination of debt and  £35m of equity by Rockpool Investments  LLP in individual companies established  for this purpose.

Since joining the Group in January 2017,  I have spent time getting to know our  two businesses, Express Gifts and Findel  Education.

During 2017, the Group has made very  promising progress in the development of its MEX-GOL, SV  and VAS gas and condensate fields in north-eastern Ukraine,  with significant improvements in production rates, leading to   a much improved financial performance. At the Group’s MEX-GOL and SV fields, production was  reasonably stable during the first half of 2017, but in June  2017, the new MEX-109 well, utilising improved drilling  and completion techniques developed as a result of recent  studies, was completed successfully and put on production,  and in August 2017, following completion of its workover,  the SV-2 well was also put on production. Together, these  successes have nearly doubled output from the MEX-GOL  and SV fields. In addition, the VAS field has continued to  produce consistently during the year. With the improved  contribution from the new wells on the MEX-GOL and SV  fields, aggregate production at the end of 2017 from all fields  was approximately 2,800 boepd. This compares with an  aggregate production rate of approximately 1,700 boepd at  the end of 2016, which represents an increase of nearly 65%  over the year. The fiscal and economic situation in Ukraine continues  to improve, with a better economic outlook, GDP growth  and improved stability in the Ukrainian Hryvnia exchange  rates, although the inflation rate did increase moderately.."

Hurricane is the first oil company to target  fractured basements in the region.

David Payne Non-Executive Chairman Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 03 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017 Dear Shareholder I am pleased to be able to report on  another year of solid progress for  Castleton. Following the acquisitive  growth of FY2015 and FY2016, FY2017  has been a year of consolidation as  we put in place firm foundations for  the Group to build on its position as a  successful niche player in software and  IT managed services within the public  sector market place. The acquisition  of seven small companies brings great  rewards but also significant integration  efforts. Despite early teething issues  previously noted, I’m delighted to say  that the business has now dealt with  these and as we enter our fourth year, we  fully expect the company to demonstrate  its growth potential. With respect to the year under review,  I am encouraged that we have  demonstrated our ability to improve  the mix of sales as the Company has  successfully transitioned to targeting  multiyear SaaS software revenues  whilst continuing to grow our overall  sales. A key success in the year has  been clearly demonstrating the highly  cash generative nature of our business  model which facilitated a reduction in our  net debt.

Diurnal has identified a number of such needs within the field of  endocrinology, which the Group believes represents a multi-billion  Dollar combined market opportunity . Diurnal is able to gain valuable  insights into the burden of living with these diseases through our  interaction with physicians and patient groups. These discussions  have helped, and continue to help, shape the Group’s development  plans, such that we can deliver products that not only address  important unmet needs and improve patients’ lives but also have  a positive impact on healthcare budgets. Investing for development and value creation During the year, Diurnal continued to make significant clinical  development progress with its late-stage pipeline products, as  well as establishing commercial operations in anticipation of  future product launches. Infacort ®  and Chronocort ®  are in  late-stage clinical development targeting indications of cortisol  deficiency: Infacort ®  has completed a Phase III clinical trial and  has been submitted for marketing authorisation in Europe, and  Chronocort ®  is currently undergoing a Phase III clinical trial  for Europe. The Group has put in place strong commercial  infrastructure in Europe to support the planned launch of  Infacort ® , for which the Group anticipates receiving market  authorisation in Europe towards the end of 2017 , at which stage  development costs will begin to be capitalised in accordance  with International Accountancy Standards (IAS). The Group plans  to leverage its investment in the commercial team through the  timely introduction of Chronocort ®  following completion of  the ongoing European Phase III clinical trial and regulatory review,  expected around the end of 2019.."

Listed on the London and Moscow  stock exchanges, we currently have a  portfolio of eight producing gold and silver  mines and an impressive pipeline of future  growth projects. In March 2018, we celebrate 20 years since  the foundation of Polymetal. During that time,  we have consistently delivered a strong  operating performance and made good on our  promises to our shareholders, employees,  communities and other stakeholders. FIND OUT MORE 06-07 OPERATING EXPERTISE 12-13 SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GROWTH PROJECTS 08-11 Dear fellow stakeholders In 2018, Polymetal celebrates its 20th anniversary;   perhaps still youthful by global metrics but, nevertheless, a  respectable milestone for a business built from the ground  up in an emerging market. During that time, the Company has  delivered a production compound annual growth rate (CAGR)  of 24%, developed 16 mines from scratch, added 6.7 Moz of  gold equivalent and 9.5 Moz of palladium equivalent in newly  discovered resources, paid out more than US$1 billion in  dividends and attained industry leadership in processing  refractory gold ore. We have expanded our operations within  three mining jurisdictions in the former Soviet Union (Russia,  Kazakhstan and Armenia) and have maintained a premium  listing on the London Stock Exchange since 2011. Playing to our strengths Over the last 20 years, we have built on our core  competencies: using a hub-based system (Dukat, Omolon  and Okhotsk); mastering POX technology and trading  refractory gold concentrates (Kyzyl, Albazino, Mayskoye);  operating successfully in difficult climatic conditions at  locations with little or no existing infrastructure (five operations  in the Russian Far East). Consistently focusing on high-grade  assets has also ensured that we have delivered superior  returns on capital. Financial prudence pays dividends Adherence to strong capital discipline has been the foundation  of our strategy – in careful project selection with a preference  for high grade and low-capital-intensity, in value-accretive  mergers & acquisitions (M&As), as well as in our dividend  policy. From free cash flow for 2012-2017 totalling US$1.3  billion, Polymetal paid out US$1.0 billion in dividends, providing  tangible returns to shareholders with a sector-leading three- year Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of 61%.."

The Report sets out information on the Burberry brand, business operations,   strategy, people and responsibility activities. The following messages from Sir John Peace and Christopher Bailey highlight   Burberry’s performance during the year and the outlook for the Company. Good early progress against Burberry’s ambitious plans. Sir John Peace Chairman As Carol Fairweather and John Smith had signalled   their intention to step down as Chief Financial Officer   and Chief Operating Officer respectively, focus was   also on the succession of these roles, with the decision   to combine them to align with the change programme. The Board unanimously supported the appointment of  Marco Gobbetti as Chief Executive Officer who will join   the Board on 5 July 2017 (with Christopher transitioning   to his new role at that time), and Julie Brown who joined   the Board as Chief Operating and Financial Officer on   18 January 2017. The Board believes that the combination   of Christopher’s creative talent and vision for Burberry   and Marco’s extensive skills in luxury and retail, as   well as Julie’s financial and commercial track record,   will provide strong leadership for the next phase of  Burberry’s evolution. The Board would like to thank Carol Fairweather for her  immense contribution to Burberry over the past ten years,  and John Smith for his contribution to Burberry over the  past seven years, first as a non-executive director and  latterly as Chief Operating Officer.."

Our d 2 w oxo-biodegradable  (OBP) controlled-life masterbatch was the first  technology of this type to be awarded an   Eco-Label, distinguishing it from all similar  products on the market. Plastic waste is a global problem which is now  dominating the media and concentrating the  minds of legislators, companies, NGOs and  scientists around the world. Plastic is vital for  our food chain because foods are safer and  stay fresher when protected in plastic, and this  reduces food waste. This is really significant, as  one third of the food produced each year   is wasted. Opponents of plastic have yet to find a viable  alternative which goes anywhere near performing  as well as plastic for most applications, and have  themselves raised concerns about food safety  and food waste. d 2 w is fully consistent with the principles of  “Reduce”, “Re-use” and “Recycle”. It is also the  best technology available for our customers,   for consumers and for the protection of   the environment. Symphony has also developed a range of plastic  technologies under the d 2 p (designed to protect)  brand, offering extra protection from bacteria,  insects, fungi, algae, odour, fouling, and fire. In  addition to these, we have recently developed  a corrosion inhibitor and a range of products  specifically designed for food packaging.."

Diurnal has identified a number of such needs within the field of  endocrinology, which the Group believes represents a multi-billion  Dollar combined market opportunity . Diurnal is able to gain valuable  insights into the burden of living with these diseases through our  interaction with physicians and patient groups. These discussions  have helped, and continue to help, shape the Group’s development  plans, such that we can deliver products that not only address  important unmet needs and improve patients’ lives but also have  a positive impact on healthcare budgets. Investing for development and value creation During the year, Diurnal continued to make significant clinical  development progress with its late-stage pipeline products, as  well as establishing commercial operations in anticipation of  future product launches. Infacort ®  and Chronocort ®  are in  late-stage clinical development targeting indications of cortisol  deficiency: Infacort ®  has completed a Phase III clinical trial and  has been submitted for marketing authorisation in Europe, and  Chronocort ®  is currently undergoing a Phase III clinical trial  for Europe. The Group has put in place strong commercial  infrastructure in Europe to support the planned launch of  Infacort ® , for which the Group anticipates receiving market  authorisation in Europe towards the end of 2017 , at which stage  development costs will begin to be capitalised in accordance  with International Accountancy Standards (IAS). The Group plans  to leverage its investment in the commercial team through the  timely introduction of Chronocort ®  following completion of  the ongoing European Phase III clinical trial and regulatory review,  expected around the end of 2019..

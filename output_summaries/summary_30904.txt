R egener a tion Construction Annual Report 2017 Who we are Morgan Sindall Group is a leading UK construction and  regeneration group. We offer support at every stage of a  project’s life cycle through our six divisions of Construction &  Infrastructure, Fit Out, Property Services, Partnership Housing,  Urban Regeneration and Investments. What we do An overview of our market Our Group strategy Our construction services  include design, new build, fit out,  refurbishment and property  maintenance, working on  standalone projects or through  strategic alliances. In regeneration  we work in close partnership with  landowners, local authorities and  housing associations to revive cities  with mixed-use developments. Four macroeconomic trends  will support long-term growth in  the Group: the housing shortage;  investment in infrastructure;  population growth; and pressure  on the public sector to achieve  savings in managing their assets. We target growing markets  that match our expertise. We specialise in construction  and regeneration, investing cash  from our construction activities  in long-term regeneration  programmes. This strategy is  supported by our objectives of  winning work, retaining talented  people, a disciplined use of  capital, maximising resources  and innovating.

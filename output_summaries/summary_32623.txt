OVERVIEW I am pleased to report that the Group continues to make good progress  and has delivered another significant increase in underlying profitability. This result was achieved despite the impact of the flood suffered at  our fabric printing factory, Standfast & Barracks, in December 2015  and reflects the success of our continued strategic focus on developing  our product offering, international expansion, market penetration,  lifestyle product extension and investment in manufacturing. It also reflects an initial contribution from the acquisition in October  2016 of Clarke & Clarke, a fabrics and wallcoverings business with two  international brands, Clarke & Clarke and Studio G. This acquisition  continues to trade in line with the Board’s expectations and is expected  to make a material contribution to earnings during the current financial  year ending 31 January 2018. We continue to seek further acquisitions  to complement our organic growth initiatives. We were very pleased with the support from both new and existing  investors for the equity fundraising of £17.0 million as part-funding for  the acquisition of Clarke & Clarke..

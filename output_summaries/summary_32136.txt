REPORTING PERIOD This year we are reporting on the 52-weeks to 1 st  April 20 1 7 compared to last year when we reported  on a 53-week basis, as every six years an additional  week is included to ensure that the year-end date  stays in line with the end of March. To provide a  meaningful comparison with this year, all ﬁ nancial  movements are reported on a 52-week basis,  and excluding the 53rd week last year, unless  otherwise noted. Details of the 53-week comparisons can be  found in the Financial Review p26. ALTERNATIVE PERFORMANCE MEASURES This report provides alternative performance  measures (APMs) which are not deﬁ ned or speciﬁ ed  under the requirements of International Financial  Reporting Standards. We believe these APMs  provide readers with important additional  information on our business. New for this year,  we have included a glossary on page 1 33 which  provides a comprehensive list of the APMs that  we use, including an explanation of how they are  calculated, why we use them and how they can be  reconciled to a statutory measure where relevant. PLAN A  Plan A is integrated throughout this report,  demonstrating how it is embedded in every part of  our business. This makes it easier for shareholders  to see how our sustainability programme is creating  value in our diff erent divisions.

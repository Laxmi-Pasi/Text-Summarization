These are non-IFRS measures which exclude the impact of the amortisation of acquisition intangible assets  (FY17: £14.1m, FY16: £10.4m). Acquisition intangible assets principally arise as a result of the past actions of the former owners of  businesses in respect of marketing and business development activity. Therefore, the adjusted measures reflect the post acquisition  revenue attributable to, and operating costs incurred by, the Group. A reconciliation between the adjusted and statutory equivalent is  included in the Financial review.

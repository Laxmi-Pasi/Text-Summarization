Corero Network Security plc Annual Report and Accounts 2017 What is a DDoS attack? A Distributed Denial of Service  attack is a cyber-threat, in which  multiple computer systems  attack a target, such as a server,  website or other network asset,  and cause a denial of service for  users of the targeted resource. The flood of incoming messages,  connection requests or  malformed packets to the target  system, forces it to slow down or  shut down, thereby denying  service to legitimate users or  systems. DDoS attacks are a  threat to service availability,  network security, brand  reputation and ultimately lead to  lost revenues. Attackers are continuing to  leverage DDoS attacks as part of  their cyber-threat arsenal to  either disrupt business  operations or provide a  smokescreen while they access  sensitive corporate information,  and they are doing it in  increasingly creative ways that  circumvent traditional security  solutions or reduce the previous  effectiveness of DDoS scrubbing  centres. 49% of companies discovered  a virus following a DDoS  attack      27 % increase in breach incidents  experienced in concert   with DDoS attacks $250,000 (per hour) revenue at risk in the   face of a DDoS attack*      90% of organisations report  some form of breach or   associated activity with  DDoS attacks Corero Network Security is a leader in real-time, high-performance  Distributed Denial of Service (“DDoS”) defence solutions.

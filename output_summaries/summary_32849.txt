During that time, the Company has  delivered a production compound annual growth rate (CAGR)  of 24%, developed 16 mines from scratch, added 6.7 Moz of  gold equivalent and 9.5 Moz of palladium equivalent in newly  discovered resources, paid out more than US$1 billion in  dividends and attained industry leadership in processing  refractory gold ore. We have expanded our operations within  three mining jurisdictions in the former Soviet Union (Russia,  Kazakhstan and Armenia) and have maintained a premium  listing on the London Stock Exchange since 2011. Playing to our strengths Over the last 20 years, we have built on our core  competencies: using a hub-based system (Dukat, Omolon  and Okhotsk); mastering POX technology and trading  refractory gold concentrates (Kyzyl, Albazino, Mayskoye);  operating successfully in difficult climatic conditions at  locations with little or no existing infrastructure (five operations  in the Russian Far East). Consistently focusing on high-grade  assets has also ensured that we have delivered superior  returns on capital. Financial prudence pays dividends Adherence to strong capital discipline has been the foundation  of our strategy – in careful project selection with a preference  for high grade and low-capital-intensity, in value-accretive  mergers & acquisitions (M&As), as well as in our dividend  policy. From free cash flow for 2012-2017 totalling US$1.3  billion, Polymetal paid out US$1.0 billion in dividends, providing  tangible returns to shareholders with a sector-leading three- year Total Shareholder Return (TSR) of 61%..

Adjusted pre-tax profit and EPS exclude share incentive scheme charges and the amortisation of  intangible assets. FY17 adjusted pre-tax profit (£53.3m) and EPS exclude share incentive scheme charges (£1.2m), amortisation of the energy  supply contract intangible asset (£11.2m), and any contribution from the Company’s former 20% shareholding in Opus Energy Group Limited  (‘Opus’) which was sold in February 2017; as a discontinued operation, and for ease of comparability, the contribution from Opus has therefore  been excluded from profit before tax and EPS for FY17 and historic accounting periods.

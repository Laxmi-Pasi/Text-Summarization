Our point-of-care (POC) products, most of which are designed and manufactured in Germany,  have a hard earned reputation for ease of use, reliability and accuracy from professionals working  in diabetes, blood banking and sports medicine. The POC business is built around a large installed base of analysers each of which generates a  regular demand for tests, often for the entire life cycle of the analyser. In 2017 we sold an estimated  70 million tests. This approach – sometimes known as the ‘razor/razorblade’ model – permits a  percentage of organic growth each year. The EKF Central Laboratory range includes clinical reagents and centrifuges which are manufactured  at premises near San Antonio, Texas. Clinical chemistry reagents are sold for use on open channel  systems or on EKF’s own brand of analysers. EKF Life Sciences, based in Elkhart, Indiana, manufactures diagnostic enzymes and contracted  custom products for use in medical diagnostics, pharmaceuticals and industry. 2017 Sales Geographical Performance  Cardiff, UK Shanghai, China Barleben, Germany San Antonio, TX Elkhart, IN Moscow, Russia Tests  sold 2017 70,217,529 2016  69,371,019 Analysers  sold 2017 14,556 2016  13,649 +7% +1m Revenue FY 2017 (£k) FY 2016 (£k) +/- (£k) APAC 4,210 3,930 +280 EMEA 17,005 15,558 +1,447 AMERICAS 20,369 19,101 +1,268 Americas (£k) FY 2017 £20,369 EMEA (£k) FY 2017 £17,005 APAC (£k) FY 2017 £4,210 Leipzig, Germany 4 Annual Report 2017  |  EKF Diagnostics Holdings plc 1.0 Strategic Review Point-of-Care: Hemoglobin Analysers Product Portfolio The hemoglobin analysers product range within EKF Diagnostics, is the largest in terms of revenues  and the size of the installed base.

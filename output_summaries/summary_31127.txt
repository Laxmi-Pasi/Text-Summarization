The small settlement of Okrainka lies some 4km from the deposit. The deposit area covers approximately 6.6km 2 . In addition to the molybdenum and tungsten content, the deposit also contains significant quantities of lithium. Since the deposit was discovered in 1964, considerable exploration work has taken place culminating in the most recent resource statement undertaken in 2005 (using the former Soviet Union resource and reserve classification system common in Central Asia), which estimated a GKZ approved Category C1 and C2 resource estimate for the northern stockwork of 37.2Mt at 0.107% molybdenum and 0.086% tungsten trioxide. This assumed a 0.05% molybdenum equivalent cut-off grade. Importantly, the first resource estimate undertaken in 1974 defined a GKZ approved estimate for the whole deposit at a C2 category of approximately 140Mt at 0.188% molybdenum..

On a statutory  basis, the prior period comparative results are for the 18 month period   ended 31 December 2016, and include the results of Partnership Assurance  Group plc (“Partnership”) only for the nine months following acquisition at the  beginning of April 2016. In order to present information that enables a clearer  comparison of results for the current year against the prior period, the Group  has chosen to present additional pro forma financial information for the 12  months ended 31 December 2016 prepared on the basis that the merger  between Just Retirement and Partnership had already taken place as at  1 January 2016. Pro forma information is unaudited. A reconciliation of pro  forma financial information to statutory financial information for the period   to 31 December 2016 is given at the end of the Financial Review section. JRP Group was renamed Just Group following a vote at the AGM on 18 May  2017. “Group”, “Company” and “Just” are used interchangeably throughout  the report to refer to Just Group plc unless explicitly stated.

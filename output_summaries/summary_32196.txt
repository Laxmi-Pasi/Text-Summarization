Wincanton plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 1 Strategic report Governance Directors’ remuneration report Directors’ report Independent auditor’s report Accounts STRATEGIC REPORT Making good  progress Steve Marshall  Chairman Strong positive cash  generation enables us  to lift our final dividend Wincanton plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2017 2 STRATEGIC REPORT CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW OUTLOOK The Group remains well positioned in its  chosen markets and continues to perform  robustly and deliver strong service levels for  customers. To date the Group has experienced  no significant impact from the Brexit vote  in June 2016, and we believe the Group can  adequately manage any future uncertainty  that arises during the Brexit process. Robust cash generation supports limited  scale investments in skills and technology  capabilities to both protect and grow the  business for the longer term without raising  the Group’s overall risk profile. During the coming year the Board expect  Wincanton to make continued progress. Steve Marshall Chairman DIVIDEND  The Board are pleased to be recommending  an increased final dividend of 6.1p per Ordinary  Share for the year ended 31 March 201 7  (2016: 5.5p)..

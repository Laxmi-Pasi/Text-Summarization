The A–Z of  experience Annual Report 2017 Landsec at   a glance Welcome to Landsec. We buy, sell, develop  and manage  commercial property   in the UK. Our aim is to create a great experience  for everyone we rely on, from our  customers to our communities,  partners and employees. We believe  that’s the best way to create long-term  sustainable value for our shareholders  and everyone else we affect. With the background of  geopolitical and economic uncertainty  affecting the UK, our markets lost  momentum during the year. However,  by having a clear strategy and acting  early, we’ve been able to achieve a  good relative performance this year. We consider both the short and   long-term effects of our actions. And in this Annual Report, we’ve  further integrated important   content about our broader social   and environmental impacts.

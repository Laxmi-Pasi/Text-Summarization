During 2017, the Group has made very  promising progress in the development of its MEX-GOL, SV  and VAS gas and condensate fields in north-eastern Ukraine,  with significant improvements in production rates, leading to   a much improved financial performance. At the Group’s MEX-GOL and SV fields, production was  reasonably stable during the first half of 2017, but in June  2017, the new MEX-109 well, utilising improved drilling  and completion techniques developed as a result of recent  studies, was completed successfully and put on production,  and in August 2017, following completion of its workover,  the SV-2 well was also put on production. Together, these  successes have nearly doubled output from the MEX-GOL  and SV fields. In addition, the VAS field has continued to  produce consistently during the year. With the improved  contribution from the new wells on the MEX-GOL and SV  fields, aggregate production at the end of 2017 from all fields  was approximately 2,800 boepd. This compares with an  aggregate production rate of approximately 1,700 boepd at  the end of 2016, which represents an increase of nearly 65%  over the year. The fiscal and economic situation in Ukraine continues  to improve, with a better economic outlook, GDP growth  and improved stability in the Ukrainian Hryvnia exchange  rates, although the inflation rate did increase moderately..

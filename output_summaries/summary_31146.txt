These APMs along with their definitions and reconciliations to IFRS measures are provided in the APMs section   on pages 176 to 179. Certain statements made in this Annual Report are forward-looking. These represent expectations for the Group’s business, and involve risks and uncertainties. The Group has based these forward-looking  statements on current expectations and projections about future events. These forward-looking statements may generally, but not always, be identified by the use of words such as ‘will’, ‘anticipates’, ‘should’,  ‘expects’, ‘is expected to’, ‘estimates’, ‘believes’, ‘intends’ or similar expressions. By their nature, forward-looking statements involve risk and uncertainty because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not occur in the future and reflect the Group’s current  expectations and assumptions as to such future events and circumstances that may not prove accurate..

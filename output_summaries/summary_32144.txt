Our aim is to grow net assets and dividends paid to shareholders  over the long term, whilst managing risk to mitigate volatility of returns. We achieve this by investing in proven well-managed businesses that  combine long term growth characteristics with an ability to deliver  increasing levels of income. Our investments cover both listed and  private markets in broadly equal proportions, a range of sectors and,  in particular through our fund investments, a global reach. The success of this strategy can be seen in the performance of Caledonia’s  NAV per share total return measured against the FTSE All-Share since  1987 and a record of 50 years of increasing its annual dividends.

Management reviews the performance of the business  principally on a proportionately consolidated basis which  includes the Group’s share of joint ventures on a line by line  basis. The key ﬁnancial performance indicators are also  presented on this basis. Alternative performance measures are ﬁnancial measures  which are not speciﬁed under IFRS but are used by  management as they highlight the underlying recurring  performance of the Group’s property rental business and are  based on the EPRA Best Practice Recommendations (BPR)  reporting framework which is widely recognised and used  by public real estate companies. Therefore, unless speciﬁcally stated, the performance metrics  and ﬁnancial results reﬂected above and in the Strategic  report reﬂect the Group’s wholly owned assets and its share  of joint venture assets. Further details and reconciliations between EPRA measures  and IFRS equivalents can be found in the Financial review on  page 35 and in note 8 to the Group ﬁnancial statements..

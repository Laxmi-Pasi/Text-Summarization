I am writing this statement in the immediate aftermath of the  tragic event of the Grenfell Tower fire in which so many people  have sadly lost their lives. Everyone here at bpha extends their  sympathy to all involved. There will be a need to review the  information that emerges from the Inquiry as that unfolds; in the  meantime working with fire service representatives we have  looked again at bpha tenants’ safety and the fire precaution  measures that are in place in the tower blocks that bpha owns. Tenants’ safety continues to be our number one priority..

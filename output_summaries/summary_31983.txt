Gleeson Homes achieved its milestone target of 1,000 unit sales per annum and has  set a new milestone target of 2,000 unit sales per annum within the next 5 years. Affordability remains very attractive and demand exceeds supply, with buyers queueing  on site opening days. The division opened another area office, bringing the total  number of area offices to seven plus two pilot offices, and has a pipeline of owned and  conditionally purchased sites containing 11,588 plots, equivalent to more than 11 years  of sales. Gleeson Strategic Land also had a record year and continues to benefit from strong  demand for consented land in prime locations from both medium sized and large  housebuilders. The division has a strong pipeline of sites, predominantly in the South  of England, which have the opportunity of developing 21,505 plots, and anticipates  continuing to enjoy a high level of success in promoting commercially attractive sites  through the planning system. The Board is confident in the Group’s short and longer term outlook.

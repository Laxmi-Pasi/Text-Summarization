The Report sets out information on the Burberry brand, business operations,   strategy, people and responsibility activities. The following messages from Sir John Peace and Christopher Bailey highlight   Burberry’s performance during the year and the outlook for the Company. Good early progress against Burberry’s ambitious plans. Sir John Peace Chairman As Carol Fairweather and John Smith had signalled   their intention to step down as Chief Financial Officer   and Chief Operating Officer respectively, focus was   also on the succession of these roles, with the decision   to combine them to align with the change programme. The Board unanimously supported the appointment of  Marco Gobbetti as Chief Executive Officer who will join   the Board on 5 July 2017 (with Christopher transitioning   to his new role at that time), and Julie Brown who joined   the Board as Chief Operating and Financial Officer on   18 January 2017. The Board believes that the combination   of Christopher’s creative talent and vision for Burberry   and Marco’s extensive skills in luxury and retail, as   well as Julie’s financial and commercial track record,   will provide strong leadership for the next phase of  Burberry’s evolution. The Board would like to thank Carol Fairweather for her  immense contribution to Burberry over the past ten years,  and John Smith for his contribution to Burberry over the  past seven years, first as a non-executive director and  latterly as Chief Operating Officer..

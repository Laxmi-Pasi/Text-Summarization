The price of oil was  consolidating and signs of recovery  across the industry were in sight. Twelve months later and the sector  has rebounded strongly. Thanks to  our efforts in 2016, Nostra Terra was  well positioned to benefit greatly  from this. The Company has since  taken significant steps forward in  realising its ambitions, delivering  robust returns for shareholders. Our strategic focus switched in 2016  to repositioning our portfolio of assets  with the goal of growing stable oil  production and reserves, which would  be profitable at $30/bbl. In particular  we sought to acquire leases, which were  Held By Production (HBP). This ideally  suited Nostra Terra because it meant we  could control the pace of development  of these assets, as conditions and our  finances allowed. In early 2017 we completed our  second acquisition in the Permian Basin,  Texas, and by April had increased the  Company’s current proven reserves (1P)  in the US to 522,000 barrels..

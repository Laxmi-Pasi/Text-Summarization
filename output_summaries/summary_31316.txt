The Board believe this  income is an integral feature of the replacement of meters, particularly prevalent during the  current smart domestic rollout, and will occur with greater regularity on an ongoing basis. All prior year underlying results have been restated in accordance with this new approach. 2 Recurring revenue refers to revenue generated by meter rental and data contracts. Annualised recurring revenue refers to the revenue being generated at a point in time. 3 Pre-exceptional EBITDA and underlying PBT figures are presented under our revised  approach to include other operating income. 4 Underlying PBT is before exceptional items and intangible amortisation..

WHAT WE DO Our 20MW ‘FlexGen’ sites – which can  generate power within 30 seconds of  being switched on remotely – provide  a vital, low cost solution to assist in  balancing the UK’s energy supply on a  moment by moment basis. Since the introduction of intermittent,  renewable power to the UK’s energy  mix as legacy carbon intensive capacity  is retired, the National Grid has faced  increasing risks of brownouts and  blackouts. UK power prices have seen  recent peaks above £1,500 per MW  hour due to outage and generation  imbalances; there is therefore a need  for a reliable source of power that can  be accessed quickly and flexibly during  periods when demand exceeds available  supply. HOW WE OPERATE Our facilities use established, reliable  technology based on containerised  generators, fired with renewable green  fuel or gas – either mains or Liquidified  Natural Gas (LNG). Nine green fuel projects have been  financed with a combination of debt and  £35m of equity by Rockpool Investments  LLP in individual companies established  for this purpose. Plutus PowerGen has a  44.5% stake in each company, and earns  fees of £150,000 per site per year from  management contracts..

Cautionary statement regarding forward- looking statements In order to utilise the ‘safe harbour’ provisions of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act 1995, we are providing the following cautionary statement: This Annual Report and Form 20-F 2002 contains certain forward-looking statements about AstraZeneca. Although we believe our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, any forward-looking statements may be influenced by factors that could cause actual outcomes and results to be materially different from those predicted. We identify the forward-looking statements by using the words ‘anticipates’, ‘believes’, ‘expects’, ‘intends’ and similar expressions in such statements. These forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties. Important factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in forward-looking statements, certain of which are beyond our control, include, among other things: the loss or expiration of patents, marketing exclusivity or trade marks; exchange rate fluctuations; the risk that R&D will not yield new products that achieve commercial success; the impact of competition, price controls and price reductions; taxation risks; the risk of substantial product liability claims; the impact  of any failure by third parties to supply materials  or services; the risk of delay to new product launches; the difficulties of obtaining and maintaining governmental approvals for products; and the risk of environmental liabilities. Statements of competitive position Except as otherwise stated, market information  in this Annual Report and Form 20-F 2002 regarding the position of our business or products relative to its or their competition is based upon published statistical data for the  12 months ended 30 September 2002, or the month of November 2002, obtained from IMS Health, a leading supplier of statistical data to the pharmaceutical industry. Except as otherwise stated, this market share and industry data from IMS Health has been derived by comparing our sales revenue to competitors’ and total market sales revenues for that period..

We have improved store profitability and have also   made progress in the development of our online channel  although there is still considerable work to do. Our est1897.co.uk site for watches is a great example of how we  can successfully use the internet for retailing backed up by our  store network. The opportunity to build on this concept for our  core services is clear and will be a key part of our future strategy..

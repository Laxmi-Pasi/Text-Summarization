Annual Report and Accounts Dixons Carphone plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2014/15 2014/15  @DixonsCarphone  “This has been a terrific first year for Dixons Carphone. We have seen excellent increases   in both sales and profitability and we have made very encouraging progress with the  tricky job of integrating these two great companies. At the same time, we have continued  to generate strong customer satisfaction numbers, made significant strides in our   Connected World Services business including our agreement with Sprint, and launched   a brand new mobile network. The job is far from done. I am acutely aware that there is no room for complacency   in a sector which has seen unprecedented change, bringing both opportunities and   challenges. We have set ourselves ambitious goals, not only financial, but also in terms   of driving customer happiness, building a completely integrated company and delivering   a brand new global services business with CWS. To achieve these, we will need to   exhibit creativity, energy, resilience and toughness of purpose. Nevertheless we are very   optimistic about the road ahead, and Dixons Carphone is lucky to have such a fantastic  team of people – in every part of the business – to deliver these goals. My sincere   thanks to them for everything that has been done so far.” Sebastian James Group Chief Executive 16 July 2015 Cautionary statement Certain statements made in this Annual Report and Accounts are forward looking.

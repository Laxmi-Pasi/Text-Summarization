The restructuring is now complete  and our remaining Care contracts have a much improved mix of longevity,  certainty of spend and price. → The Care division returned to profit as planned, delivering an operating profit  for the full year of £0.5m (2016: loss £1.2m), representing an operating margin  for the second half of 2.3%..

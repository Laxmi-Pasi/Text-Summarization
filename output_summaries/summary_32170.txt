By designing GP surgery premises for the  job they’ll be doing in future, we can help  the NHS deliver on its plans to ease pressure  on hospitals – by giving family doctors the  infrastructure they need to offer extended  appointment hours, digital consultations  and more services, tests and treatment  in the community. Whether we’re developing new buildings  or investing to make existing spaces work  better, we’re helping to create a primary   care estate today that’s in shape for   the NHS of tomorrow.

We summarise our latest  improvements across. Integrated reporting has become modern best practice  for annual reporting, adopted by a growing community  of organisations that have recognised that strategy, risk,  performance and sustainability are inseparable and are   integral to an organisation’s success. The International Integrated Reporting Council (IRRC) define  an integrated report as “a concise communication about how  an organisation’s strategy, governance, performance and  prospects, in the context of its external environment, lead to  the creation of value in the short, medium and long-term” . Find out more about integrated reporting at:   Changes to this year’s Annual Report and  Financial Statements We continue to evolve our Annual Report to meet latest  business, stakeholder and legislative requirements, to follow  best practice, and to embed the principles of the integrated  approach. This year we have: •  Included more information to explain how we assure the  contents of this publication. We make clear what assurance  route has been used for each report included within this  Annual Report and Financial Statements (ARFS). •  The Strategic Report has been updated to further develop  the summary of our strategy and business model, including  further explanation of our resources and relationships, and  how we perform relative to others. We have also reviewed  our reporting of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to clarify  those which are regulatory and to report the headlines  of our ambition to go further, with links to further  information on our website. •  Expanded our explanation of risk, introducing a ‘heat map’  and showing risk movement in the year..

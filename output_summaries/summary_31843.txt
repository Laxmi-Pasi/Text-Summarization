GTV reflects the full retail sales value of digital  sales, agency sales (including sales by business partners on GAME’s  Marketplace website), warranties and other similar arrangements and  thereby includes the publishers’ and sellers’ shares of those transactions. GTV provides the most reliable measure of activity in an environment where  more sales are expected to move from physical to digital.

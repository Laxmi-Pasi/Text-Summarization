share is defined as profit or loss for the year before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment  properties and the associated tax impacts as well as exceptional tax items and deferred tax charges, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue (excluding shares held by the  Safestore Employee Benefit Trust). 2  CER is constant exchange rates (Euro-denominated results for the current period have been retranslated at the exchange rate effective for the comparative period in order to present the  reported results on a more comparable basis). 3  Like-for-like adjustments have been made to remove the impact of the 2016 openings of Wandsworth, Altrincham, Birmingham (including closure of our existing Birmingham store) and  Emerainville, as well as Chiswick and Combs-la-Ville and the closure of Deptford in the current financial year. In addition, the impact of the acquisition of Space Maker on 29 July 2016 has  been adjusted. 4  Underlying EBITDA is defined as operating profit before exceptional items, corporate transaction costs, change in fair value of derivatives, gain/loss on investment properties, contingent rent  and depreciation. Underlying profit before tax is defined as underlying EBITDA less leasehold rent, depreciation charged on property, plant and equipment and net finance charges relating to  bank loans and cash. 5   Profit before tax decreased by £16.0 million to £78.9 million (FY2016: £94.9 million) principally as a result of exceptional costs totalling £17.7 million (FY2016: exceptional income of  £4.3 million), which includes exceptional refinancing costs of £16.3 million, and a reduction in the gain on investment properties by £2.5 million to £39.2 million (FY2016: £41.7 million),  offset by an improvement in underlying EBITDA of £8.7 million..

In 2017 Genel delivered  on that potential. I am now more confident than ever that,  while challenges remain, there is material  upside in the Genel portfolio and significant  opportunities ahead. As we enter 2018,  I believe that we have both the right strategy  to take advantage of these and the right  management team to deliver on that strategy. The macroeconomic climate altered again in  2017. On the positive side, the increase in the  oil price helped to boost cash flows from our  producing assets, and also provided a more  solid basis for the economy of the Kurdistan  Region of Iraq (‘KRI’)..

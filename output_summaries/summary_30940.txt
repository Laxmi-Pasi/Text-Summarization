Our franchisees are fully insured  members of professional bodies, supported  by specialist software, who know their   local rental market and manage all   properties locally. Estate Agency We operate on a no sale no fee basis. We  cater both for the majority of sellers who  prefer to instruct an agent operating from  high street premises and for the growing  segment of sellers who choose to use an  agent without a high street office. Two of our  brands have been engaged in estate agency  for more than 150 years. How we do it We rely on the motive power of local people  who are committed to operating franchises  under our brands to the highest levels of  professionalism and service. Our brands are  household names in their local communities,  regions and nationally..

At the same time the Group achieved impressive growth in line with market expectations, delivering an increase in Group  revenue of 65.1%, including 19.8% organic growth. The Group’s transformation consisted of the acquisition of Systems Professional Limited (“Sys-Pro”) in early July,  complementing the Group’s existing managed services business, and an associated re-branding of the business from  Daily Internet Plc to SysGroup Plc. This, combined with the subsequent disposal of the Company’s legacy, non-core  SME Mass Market hosting division, resulted in the formation of a business focused exclusively on servicing the high value  managed services market, with a strong focus on cloud. To facilitate the funding of the Sys-Pro, the Group completed an oversubscribed placing in July raising £5.0m gross and  bringing a number of new institutional shareholders onto the Company’s register. In conjunction with the placing and  acquisition, the Company also undertook a 40 for 1 share consolidation and sought court approval for the cancellation of  its share premium account, leaving the parent company able to pay dividends in the future should it be appropriate to do  so (see note 22). In order to support the new business composition and operational focus, a number of organisational changes were  implemented to restructure the Group, including the appointment of Julian Llewellyn as CFO and Amy Yateman-Smith as  Non-Executive Director..

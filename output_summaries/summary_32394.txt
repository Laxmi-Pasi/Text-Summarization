David Payne Non-Executive Chairman Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements 03 Castleton Technology plc Annual Report 2017 Dear Shareholder I am pleased to be able to report on  another year of solid progress for  Castleton. Following the acquisitive  growth of FY2015 and FY2016, FY2017  has been a year of consolidation as  we put in place firm foundations for  the Group to build on its position as a  successful niche player in software and  IT managed services within the public  sector market place. The acquisition  of seven small companies brings great  rewards but also significant integration  efforts. Despite early teething issues  previously noted, I’m delighted to say  that the business has now dealt with  these and as we enter our fourth year, we  fully expect the company to demonstrate  its growth potential. With respect to the year under review,  I am encouraged that we have  demonstrated our ability to improve  the mix of sales as the Company has  successfully transitioned to targeting  multiyear SaaS software revenues  whilst continuing to grow our overall  sales. A key success in the year has  been clearly demonstrating the highly  cash generative nature of our business  model which facilitated a reduction in our  net debt. The Board There have been changes at Board  level as the Group puts in place our  foundations for future growth. Dean Dickinson joined the Board as  CEO on 31 October 2016, replacing Ian  Smith who became Executive Deputy  Chairman..

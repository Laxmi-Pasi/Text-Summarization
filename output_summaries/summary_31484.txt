COMPLETION OF GROWTH ACCELERATION PLAN In 2017 , Informa delivered a fourth consecutive year of growth   in revenue, adjusted earnings, cash flow and dividends. The year  also saw the Group fulfil its ambition to return all four Operating  Divisions to positive underlying revenue growth. These results are built on the foundations of the previous four  years, and the measures taken under GAP to increase the  Group’s focus on customers and vertical industries, build market  positions and strengthen overall operational capabilities. This started with talent and experience, including appointing   new Divisional CEOs and a dedicated CTO in each Division. It continued through proactive portfolio management, exiting  businesses and markets that were not core or where we were  sub-scale, and expanding in geographies and verticals where the  growth opportunities were most attractive, particularly in the US..

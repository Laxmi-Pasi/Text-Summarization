PA S SI ON THE SECRET  I NG R E DI E N T ANNUAL REPORT   AND ACCOUNTS 2017 Fuller, Smith & Turner P.L.C. Annual Report and Accounts 2017 TH E PE R F E C T M IX For us, brewing beer and running pubs is not just  our business. It’s our passion. We bring everything  to it, committing all our energy and creativity to  make Fuller’s beers, pubs and hotels just that   little bit more special than the competition. Our enduring London roots are symbolic of the  spirit and imagination we bring to our business. We never stop exploring new ways to make   things better, more interesting, more Fuller’s. We genuinely believe every one of our beers and pubs  deserves to be celebrated for its individuality and unique  character. And this holds true for our people too, whose  unique talents are behind it all, making the real difference  to everything we do for our customers. While every Fuller’s beer and pub does stand proudly   on its own – each an achievement in its own right –   the Fuller’s name tells you they have all been crafted   with the same passion, care and attention to detail that   we bring to everything we do. This is what it means to be part of Fuller’s..

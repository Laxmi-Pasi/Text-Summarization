Of course, the changing face of regulation is dominating the  backdrop for IG’s core product at the moment. The regulatory  situation is in a state of flux, and it could take some time for clarity  to be available in all markets. I am, however, pleased that the  management and the entire IG team have continued to concentrate  on developing the business, while engaging constructively with  regulators and innovating to further improve client outcomes. The recent increase in regulatory concerns around retail leveraged  trading is perhaps no surprise. Like any growing profitable industry,  competition has increased in recent years..

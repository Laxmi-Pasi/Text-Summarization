Crop enhancement –  advancing the science  of crop potential PLANT IMPACT PLC  Annual Report 2017 PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017 PLANT IMPACT PLC | ANNUAL REPORT 2017 Our starting  point is plant  science What we do We understand physiological   stress responses and resource  prioritisation in key world crops. This enables us to create and  identify novel synthetic and defined  small molecule chemicals that can  be applied as crop enhancement  (sometimes known as biostimulant) foliar sprays and seed treatments. Our products are easy to use and  consistently improve crop yields  under a range of growth conditions. Why we do it Increasing global demand for food  needs to be met overwhelmingly by  increasing yields on the existing  world farm. The rate of crop yield  increases is falling in all crops in  most parts of the world. Crop  enhancement products are a new  category in the grower’s toolkit to  unlock otherwise lost crop yield and  help to sustainably increase food  and animal feed worldwide.

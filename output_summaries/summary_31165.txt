Our  strategy is to develop leading brands and to be diversified and balanced  across geographies and sectors. Our spread of operations minimises the  dependence on any single market, so reducing the impact from market  fluctuations and other external factors. Each brand is a specialist in their  niche market, enabling them to understand the needs of clients and  candidates alike, allowing them to attack the market vertically rather than  horizontally. We differentiate ourselves in the marketplace by our four core  business model pillars: Multi-branded model See page 02 Management equity  philosophy See page 04 Focus on growth  markets See page 06 Operational focus  on temporary and  contract recruitment See page 08 Our vision is to be a  leading international,  specialist staffing group.

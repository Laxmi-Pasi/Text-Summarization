Since joining the Group in January 2017,  I have spent time getting to know our  two businesses, Express Gifts and Findel  Education. Both have leading positions  in their respective markets and have  strategies to build on the progress of  recent years, evolving their operating  models to cater for their customers’  future demands and ways of shopping. I’m excited about the opportunity for  sustainable growth in a marketplace  for value‑ conscious customers who are  rapidly moving their purchases online,  although there is a significant amount of  further work required to achieve that goal. The new executive management team  that we announced at the start of April  2017, led by Phil Maudsley, have a wealth  of relevant experience that will be used to  deliver this growth..

This represents a major milestone in the Group’s strategic development, transitioning to a banking group  deriving significant funding from retail deposits, while providing new finance options for underserved  UK customers. The Group has also made progress in its asset diversification strategy, which will support its medium-term  objective of improving net interest margin and cost efficiency, with increasing business volumes capable of  being supported by the investments in operations, infrastructure and start-up costs already being put in place..

Revenue from continuing operations was steady compared with the prior  year, and the net loss for the year came in line with the Board’s expectations. Financial results and condition   Revenues for the current year amounted to £2.00m, compared with £2.08m in the prior year (stated before  the IntelliSAW related license fee of £3.04m). Administrative expenses increased to £3.32m from £2.54m  in the prior year. This increase in expenditure reflects new product support and the commercial and  marketing activity within Translogik to launch iTrack II and deliver effective pre-contract engagement with  a number of key customers for this system. The pre tax loss from continuing operations for the year was £2.16m compared with a profit of £1.59m  and loss in the prior year adjusted for the effects of the net IntelliSAW licence fee of £1.17m. The total  loss attributable to shareholders was £2.17m (2016: profit of £1.15m) resulting in a net loss per ordinary  share of 22.84 pence (2016: earnings of 12.90 pence). The Board do not recommend payment of a  dividend (2016: Nil). Net cash balances at 30 June 2017 were £2.52m (2016: £3.65m). Strategy  The Group provides innovative sensor systems for various complex applications and operates two  principal businesses, SAWSense and Translogik..

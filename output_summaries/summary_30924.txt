In March 2017 the Board appointed Jill Smith as President and Chief Executive Officer (CEO). Jill’s extensive  leadership experience, including most recently as CEO of DigitalGlobe where she led the business to growth  and a successful IPO, is well-aligned with our overarching priorities at Allied Minds: to deliver shareholder returns  by driving commercialisation and monetisations at our key subsidiaries, and building a growth engine of new  investments..

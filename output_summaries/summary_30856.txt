Responsible  consumer finance   Annual Report  and Financial Statements 2017 Alternative Performance Measures This Annual Report and Financial Statements provides alternative performance measures (APMs) which are not defined or specified   under the requirements of International Financial Reporting Standards. We believe these APMs provide readers with important additional  information on our business. To support this we have included an accounting policy note on APMs on page 101, a reconciliation of the  APMs we use where relevant and a glossary on pages 133 to 136 indicating the APMs that we use, an explanation of how they are  calculated and why we use them. Cautionary statement The purpose of this report is to provide information to the members of the Company. It has been prepared for, and only for, the members of the Company,  as a body, and no other persons. The Company, its directors and employees, agents or advisors do not accept or assume responsibility to any other  person to whom this document is shown or into whose hands it may come and any such responsibility or liability is expressly disclaimed. The Annual  Report and Financial Statements contain certain forward-looking statements with respect to the operations, performance and financial condition of the  Group. By their nature, these statements involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can cause results and developments to differ materially  from those anticipated. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge and information available at the date of preparation of the Annual Report and  Financial Statements and the Company undertakes no obligation to update these forward-looking statements (other than to the extent required by  legislation and the Listing Rules and the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority). Nothing in this yearâ€™s Annual Report   and Financial Statements should be construed as a profit forecast..

We have a well-established strategy, a clear  vision, robust values and great people. The company’s success is driven by a strong portfolio of market  leading brands including Cathedral City cheese, Clover dairy  spread, Country Life butter and Frylight, the original one calorie  cooking spray. The year ended 31 March 2017 marked a new chapter in our  history as we started production of two functional ingredients,  demineralised whey powder and galacto-oligosaccharide (‘GOS’)   at our Davidstow facility. This brings exciting new opportunities   in the high growth global infant formula market. We strive constantly to innovate, bringing new products to market  and introducing new ways of working across the business. Our success has been built on our links to the countryside, our  dairy heritage and our people and we continue to ensure we are  setting the standard for responsible business practice.

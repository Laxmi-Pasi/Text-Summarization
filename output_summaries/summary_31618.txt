For	clarity,	this	 excludes	all: –	 biennial	events; –	 timing	differences	(i.e. events	that	ran	in	only	one	of	the	current	or	comparative	periods,	due	to	changes	in	the	event	dates); –	 launches; –	 cancelled	or	disposed	of	events	that	did	not	take	place	under	our	ownership	in	the	current	year; –	 acquired	events	in	the	current	period;	and –	 acquired	events	in	the	comparative	period	that	didn’t	take	place	under	our	ownership	in	the	comparative	period	(i.e. they	took	place	pre-acquisition). 4	 Forward	bookings	are	contracted	revenues	for	the	year	ending	30	September	2018. These	are	the	bookings	as	at	24	November	2017,	unless	otherwise	stated. 5	 Core	events	are	those	of	strategic	importance	to	our	future	and	include	the	Group’s	largest	events,	those	with	the	greatest	potential	for	growth	and	a	number	of	smaller	but	 strategically	important	events. Following	the	strategic	review,	the	Group	deliberately	segmented	its	business	into	Core	and	Non-Core,	enabling	management	to	increase	its	focus	 on	events	that	present	the	greatest	opportunities	whilst	reducing	distraction	from	smaller	events..
